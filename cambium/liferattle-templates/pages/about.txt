<h1>About Us</h1>
<p class="pagetext">Through Life Rattle Press and the Life Rattle radio program, Life Rattle searches out, edits, records, broadcasts and publishes experience based prose by new writers from a variety of communities in the Toronto area.</p>
<p class="pagetext">On Sunday morning, February 6, 1988, Arnie Achtman broadcast Life Rattle on CKLN 88.1 FM for the first time.</p>
<p class="pagetext">In 1995, we launched Life Rattle Press, a nonprofit publisher of high-quality, editions of stories by new writers.</p>
<p class="pagetext">Life Rattle provides a system of support and encouragement to new writers. Our loose collective of writers and editors offers professional-level editing to people who normally might not be able to access or even know about such services. We also offer instruction and support to writers recording their writing for the first time. Life Rattle also helps gifted writers to access grant support and other means of publication and recognition.</p>
<p class="pagetext">Life Rattle presents an alternative to a culture where passive spectatorism is the fate of many who come to feel that expression is an opportunity reserved for an elite few. Life Rattle stresses the expression of censored experience, experience that schools and other guardians of “culture” ignore or marginalize.</p>
<p class="pagetext">The stories of Life Rattle are the stories of our city and its cultures. Storytelling is a way of making ourselves known to others and of making ourselves known to ourselves.</p>

<h1>Life Rattle Founders</h1>
Arnie Achtman and Guy Allen worked together for twenty-five years to carry out their vision of autobiographical storytelling and writing as a form of community activism. Achtman broadcast the first Life Rattle radio show on February 6, 1988. The two collaborated with many others to build the Life Rattle radio program, Life Rattle Press, a nonprofit publisher of new writers, and the well-known Totally Unknown Writers Festival.

<strong>Biography: Arnie Achtman</strong>
Born in 1948, in Montreal, Achtman worked as a store clerk, a short-order cook, a dance studio caretaker, an independent performance artist, an actor and for the past twenty years taught Expressive Writing at George Brown College, and more recently at the University of Toronto.
Arnie Achtman died March 7, 2005 at 11:00 a.m., succumbing to lung cancer.

Two months before his death, Arnie celebrated the publication of This is What Happened, a collection written by a group of his former George Brown students who continue to meet as the Friday Night Writers Group.
Eight days before his death, Arnie, helped by brother Bernie, wheelchaired his way, oxygen tanks in tow, to CKLN to host Life Rattle (show # 869) for the last time. When he managed the breath to deliver, without coughs or gasps, the show's introduction, he pumped his fist in the air.

Thank you Arnie.

<strong>Biography: Guy Allen</strong>
Born in 1947, in Little Rock, Arkansas, Allen has worked as an assembly line worker, a butler, a taxi driver, and a sportswriter. He now serves as Director of the Professional Writing and Communication Program at the University of Toronto at Mississauga.
